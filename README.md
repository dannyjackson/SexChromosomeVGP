# README for SexChromosomeVGP Repository

The scripts and code in this repository are used to analyze broad patterns across the vertebrate tree of life in sex chromosome evolution. These efforts are part of a broader collaboration led by Drs. Simone Gabel and Melissa Wilson.

## The specific analyses that I performed are:
1. Plotting pseudoautosomal lengths by species across clades of interest (subrepo [PAR_phylogeny](https://github.com/dannyjackson/SexChromosomeVGP/PAR_phylogeny))
2. Identifying genes at the PAR boundaries in each taxa (subrepo [PAR_genes](https://github.com/dannyjackson/SexChromosomeVGP/PAR_genes))

## NOTE BEFORE PUBLICATION:
These VGP genomes are occasionally being updated with new releases. Vance and I may pull more recent versions into the genome repository. If we do, we update the two sheets pasted below. Prior to publication, confirm that all analyses were run *after* the latest date of change of the raw genomes. Rerun analyses using updated versions for updated genomes.
