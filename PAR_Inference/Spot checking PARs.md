# Spot checking PARs

Acanthisitta_chloris has a gigantic W and a small Z... do we think these are just mislabelled?

Bos taurus doesn't have a Y in the assembly and the listed chromosome accession numbers are for the X: CM011833.1 which has the wrong length and NC_040105.1 which has the correct length. I'm removing the PAF from analyses.
Same situation for Dama dama and Lycaon pictus.
